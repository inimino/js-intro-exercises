<h1>2048 UI in React</h1>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
In this challenge, you will create the UI for the 2048 game, as it exists <a href="../2048/">here</a>, using React.

<p>
We'll use <a href="https://play.inimino.org/#max">Play</a> again for this exercise, so create a new empty space, and start with the following:

<textarea id=code></textarea>

<script>
document.querySelector('#code').value = "<!doctype html>\n<title>2048</title>\n<link rel=stylesheet href=\"https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.css\">\n<script src=\"https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.js\"></scr"+"ipt>\n\n<div id=container>\n</div>\n\n# JSX\n"
</script>

<p>This is the same as yesterday, but now we are adding JSX instead of just plain JavaScript.

<p>The functions you need to use from the provided JavaScript library, and the CSS that's available, the same as in the <a href=https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/exercises/002-React.html>React without React exercise</a>.
