<h1>2048 UI in React</h1>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
In this challenge, you will create the UI for the 2048 game, as it exists <a href="../2048/">here</a>, using React.

<p>
Start <a href=https://gist.github.com/inimino/e20aeee01d6145995c9f67169f1215a3>here</a>.

<p>
Copy the files onto your local machine.

<p>
The index.html file includes everything you need to write JSX inside of the file.
It loads React and Babel from a CDN.

<p>
Start by creating components for the Cell and Row, and then put them all together to display the complete game.

<p>This is the same as yesterday, but now we are adding JSX instead of just plain JavaScript.

<p>The functions you need to use from the provided JavaScript library, and the CSS that's available, the same as in the <a href=https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/exercises/002-React.html>React without React exercise</a>.
