<h1>React without React</h1>

<p>In this challenge, we are going to learn how React works, but we won't be using React.

<p>Instead, you're going to implement the same flow that we would in a React app, but using pure DOM methods instead of React.

<p>The purpose is to get more familiar with the DOM, and to understand the declarative style of React applications.

<p>There is a game object, which contains the entire state of the game, such as the values of each tile, the current score, etc.

<p>There is already JavaScript code that handles all the game logic, such as handling a move, updating the score, creating a new game, etc.
However, this code doesn't know anything about the UI.
It only looks at the game object, and creates a new game object.

<p>To get started, create an HTML file, and paste the following code into it:

<textarea id=start>
</textarea>

<script>
document.querySelector('#start').value=
"<!doctype html>\n<title>2048</title>\n<link rel=stylesheet href=\"https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.css\">\n<script src=\"https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.js\"></scr"+"ipt>\n\n<div id=container>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // start here\n</scr"+"ipt>"
</script>

<p>Notice the HTML includes a 
<a href=https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.css>CSS</a>
 file and a JS file already.

<p>You can open these in separate tabs to compare against the markup you need to generate.

<p>The CSS is to save you time styling the game tiles, and the JS library implements the game logic.
What you need to write is the UI, or the view layer in MVC terms.

<p>The JavaScript library provides two functions you will need:

<ul>
<li>create_game()
<p>This creates a new game object. You will need to call this function once when the page is loaded.
<li>move(game, name)
<p>The move() function takes a game object and a move name, which can be either "up", "down", "left", or "right". You may remember it from the 2048 AI exercise yesterday.
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Make a game object</h3>

<p>First, you're going to need to create an object to store the state of the game.
You might as well create a variable, call it <code>game</code>, and use create_game() to initialize it.

<h3>Turn the game object into HTML</h3>

<p>Console.log the game object to understand the structure.

<p>Next you are going to need to write a function that takes the game object and renders it as HTML.
You could call this function game_html(), and it should take the game object as an argument, and return an HTML string.
Check <a href="https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.css">the CSS</a> to see what elements and classes to use.
You should create a &lt;div class="Row"> for each row in the game board, and fill it with &lt;div class="Cell"> divs, adding the "val-0" or "val-2" through "val-2048" classes as appropriate.

<p>To test your <code>game_html</code> function, you should console.log the result.
For example, you should run <code>console.log(game_html(game_object))</code>.

<h3>Add the HTML onto the page</h3>

<p>Next you should write a function to take your HTML string and inject it into the page, with innerHTML on the container div.
You can call this function <code>render(html, element)</code> and pass the container element to it as the second argument.
Your render function will just set <code>element.innerHTML = html</code>.

<p>To call your render function, you will need to generate the HTML, and select the DOM element to inject the HTML into.
You will have something like this:

<pre><code>
var html = game_html(game_object)
var container = document.querySelector('#container')

render(html, container)
</code></pre>

<h3>Make the game playable</h3>

<p>To make the game playable, you should add four buttons, up, down, left, and right.
Style and place them using CSS.

<p>When a button is pushed, use the move() function to get the updated state of the game.
This should look something like <code>game = move(game,move_type)</code>.
Then call your game_html() function again to get the new HTML, and your render() function again to display the HTML on the page.
Now you have a playable game!

<p>When you are done it should look something like the <a href="https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/2048/">demo version.</a>

<h3>Extras</h3>

<p>Optionally, you can add a "new game" button, which should create a new game and render it.

<p>You can add an "onkeydown" handler to the document to support keyboard input and play with the arrow keys.
<p>If you finish all the above, you can also add an "autoplay" button.
There is also an ai_player() function provided by the JS library, you can use this to get the next move, then apply the move as usual, render, and set a timeout to get the next move and repeat the whole process.
