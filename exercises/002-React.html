<h1>React without React</h1>

<p>In this challenge, we are going to learn how React works, but we won't be using React.

<p>Instead, you're going to implement the same flow that we would in a React app, but using pure DOM methods instead of React.

<p>The purpose is to get more familiar with the DOM, and to understand the declarative style of React applications.

<p>There is a game object, which contains the entire state of the game, such as the values of each tile, the current score, etc.

<p>There is already JavaScript code that handles all the game logic, such as handling a move, updating the score, creating a new game, etc.
However, this code doesn't know anything about the UI.
It only looks at the game object, and creates a new game object.

<p>You will write a loop

<p>To get started, create a new empty workspace in Play, and copy and paste the following code into it:

<textarea id=start>

<script>
document.querySelector('#start').value=
"<!doctype html>\n<title>2048</title>\n<link rel=stylesheet href=\"https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.css\">\n<script src=\"https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.js\"></scr"+"ipt>\n\n<div id=container>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // start here\n</scr"+"ipt>"
</script>

<p>We aren't using any Play features, this is just a plain HTML file. So you can also paste it into an HTML file locally and use Sublime Text if you prefer.

<p>Notice the HTML includes a CSS file and a JS file already.

<p>The CSS is to save you time styling the game tiles, and the JS library implements the game logic.
What you need to write is the UI, or the view layer in MVC terms.

<p>The JavaScript library provides two functions you will need:

<ul>
<li>create_game()
<p>This creates a new game object. You will need to call this function once when the page is loaded.
<li>move(game, name)
<p>The move() function takes a game object and a move name, which can be either "up", "down", "left", or "right". You may remember it from the 2048 AI exercise yesterday.

<p>First, you're going to need to create an object to store the state of the game.
You might as well create a variable, call it <code>game</code>, and use create_game() to initialize it.

<p>Next you are going to need to write a function that takes the game object and renders it as HTML.
You should name this function render(), and you might as well give it the DOM element to render into as a second argument.

<p>You should call this render(game,element) function once, and it should render your UI into the element provided.
For this you can use the DOM methods like element.innerHTML, element.appendChild, document.createElement.
Check <a href="https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/lib/2048.css">the CSS</a> to see what elements and classes to use.
You should create a &lt;div class="Row"> for each row in the game board, and fill it with &lt;div class="Cell"> divs, adding the "val-0" or "val-2" through "val-2048" classes as appropriate.

<p>When the game starts, the board is empty except for one randomly placed 2 or 4 tile.
You need to show that state, which means you need to write some code that generates HTML from your game state.
If you wanted, you could also write code to update the board every time the player moves.
You could move your HTML elements around, or change the attributes of the elements in place.
Instead of that, we are going to use the same function to show the initial state of the page and to show the state again after every change.

<p>To make the game playable, you should add four buttons, up, down, left, and right.
Style and place them using CSS.

<p>When a button is pushed, use the move() function to get the updated state of the game.
Then call your render(game,element) function again!
Now you have a playable game!

<p>When you are done it should look something like the <a href="https://inimino.github.io/js-intro-exercises/2048/">demo version.</a>

<h3>Extras</h3>

<p>Optionally, you can add a "new game" button, which should create a new game and render it.

<p>You can add an "onkeydown" handler to the document to support keyboard input and play with the arrow keys.

<p>If you finish all the above, you can also add an "autoplay" button.
There is also an ai_player() function provided by the JS library, you can use this to get the next move, then apply the move as usual, render, and set a timeout to get the next move and repeat the whole process.
