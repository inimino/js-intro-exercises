<h1>React without React</h1>

<p>In this challenge, we are going to learn how React works, but we won't be using React.

<p>Instead, you're going to implement the same flow that we would in a React app, but using pure DOM methods instead of React.

<p>The purpose is to get more familiar with the DOM, and to understand the declarative style of React applications.

<p>There is a game object, which contains the entire state of the game, such as the values of each tile, the current score, etc.

<p>There is already JavaScript code that handles all the game logic, such as handling a move, updating the score, creating a new game, etc.
However, this code doesn't know anything about the UI.
It only looks at the game object, and creates a new game object.

<p>You will write a loop

<p>To get started, create a new empty workspace in Play, and copy and paste the following code into it:

<textarea id=start>

<script>
document.querySelector('#start').value=

</script>
