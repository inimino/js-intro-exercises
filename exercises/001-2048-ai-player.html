<title>2048 AI Exercise</title>
<section id=instructions>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>In this challenge, you will write an AI to play the game 2048.

  <p>You can see our version of the 2048 game <a href=2048>here</a>.
  You can play using the buttons or the arrow keys on the keyboard.
  Note that there is also an "autoplay" button which you can click at any time to play for you.

  <p>We will use <a href="https://github.com/inimino/play/">Play</a> for this exercise.

  <p>First, you need your own empty Play project.
  Pick a username (you can use your github username) and create a unique URL for yourself.
  Start from <a href="https://play.inimino.org/">here</a>.
  Your URL should look like this:
  <code>https://play.inimino.org/~{username}/2048-ai-exercise</code>

  <p>Now you have an empty project.
  To load the code for the exercise itself, enter exactly the following on the first line: 
  
  <p><code># load 2048-ai-exercise</code>

  <p>You will write your own JavaScript code below this.

  <p>Now that the exercise code is loaded, you should see that the game board has appeared.
  This is the same code as the full game, but without the buttons or the keyboard handlers, so it is not playable.
  Instead of playing it, you are going to write code to play it for you.

  <p>You will write a function, called <code>ai_player</code>, which will get the game position as an argument, and choose the next move to make.

  <p>Once you have written your ai_player function, click the autoplay button to run it and see how well it can score!

  <p>The challenge code will run your player until it stops making progress, and then after a short pause it will clear the board and run it again. You can let your player run in a loop and see the running average score.

  <p>Your function `ai_player` should take one argument, which will be the game state, and should return a string, which is either `up`, `down`, `left`, or `right` according to the move it wants to make.

  <p>For example, the following creates a simple but determined AI player with a strong preference for moves to the left:

  <pre><code>
    function ai_player(game){
      return 'left';
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>You can start by writing a player that moves randomly. For this you'll want to use <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random>Math.random()</a>.

  <p>To do better than this, you'll need to examine the <code>game</code> object that is passed to you, and somehow use it to choose a good move.

  <p>Remember, you can use console.log() for debugging. <code>console.log(game)</code> will show you what the game object contains.

  <p>You may use the following functions to help you in your quest:
  <ul>
    <li>move(game, move_name)
      <p>Example:
      <pre><code>
      let cp = move(game,"left")
      // see what changed
      console.log(game) // the original game state
      console.log(cp) // what it looks like after moving left
      </code></pre>
      <p>This returns a new game object, after a move has been made.
      This is the same function that the game itself uses as you play, or as your AI plays.
      Each move() has two parts.
      First it moves and combines the tiles already present, and then it randomly adds a new tile.
      You can also call these methods separately.
    <li>move_only(game, move_name)
      <p>Example: 
      <pre><code>
      console.log(game)
      let cp = move_only(game,"left")
      console.log(cp)
      console.log(cp.score)
      console.log(cp.last_move_effect) // true if the board is different
      </code></pre>
      <p>Returns a new game object, with the effect of a move, if any, but without adding the random tile.
    <li>randomly_add_tile(game)
      <p>Returns a new game object, with a tile (2 or 4) randomly added to one of the empty spaces.
    <li>is_lost(game)
      <p>This returns a Boolean that just tells you whether the game is lost.
      A game is lost when there are no more moves to play.
    <li>legal_moves
      <p>This is an array equal to ["up","down","left","right"].
      You can use <code>legal_moves.forEach(...)</code> when you want to test something for all moves.
  </ul>

  <p>The random player approach is the easiest.
  Even though the play is random, the results of the random player are surprisingly consistent.
  To move randomly, you don't need to look at the game object at all.
  You can use Math.random() to get a random number, and then use this to choose one of the moves at random.
  The legal_moves array can help.
  Use Math.random() to get a number between 0 and 1, and then multiply by four and use Math.floor() to get a number that is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
  Use this number as an index into the legal_moves array.

  <p>If you have extra time, here are some other ideas you can try:

  <p>Now you have a random player, and you have the is_lost() function provided.
  You could combine these to make random moves until the game is lost.
  Actually ... that is what we are doing now, but you could do it inside your ai_player function, on each move, before deciding which move to make.
  By counting the number of moves before losing, it would give you a cheap and simple way of evaluating a position.
  In other words, you could try moving left, right, up, down, and for each of these new positions, make random moves until losing, and then choose the one that loses after the longest streak of moves.
  Since both the moves and the tiles are being added randomly, this process relies on chance, but it will give you better results than the fully random player.

  <p>For an even better player, there are lots of techniques we can use from AI.
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax>Minimax search</a> is a good one to look into here.
